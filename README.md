## Logic

This mod fires price updates twice. Once when you initially spawn into the game. Then every day at the start of a new day.

The logic includes lookups against the inflation index per product category to ensure optimal prices are being set.

## How To

You must have BepInEx already installed to run this mod.

Visit the [Installating BepInEx Guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) if you don't already have BepInEx installed.

Ensure BepInEx is downloaded and in the correct location within the Supermarket Together directory.
