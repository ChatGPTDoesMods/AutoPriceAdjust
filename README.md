## Logic

At the beginning of each day the person with the mod needs to press the Green Button to start the day. 

⚠You do not need to be the host of the lobby, as long as you are the one to press the Green Button to start the day.⚠

The logic includes lookups against the inflation index per product category to ensure optimal prices are being set.
